Hello and welcome. I'm McCrea Cobb, a biometrician with the refuge's Inventory and Monitoring Program, based in Anchorage, Alaska. My coauthors on this presentation represent other programs in Alaska - Erik Osnas with Migratory Birds, Amy Pocewicz with Science Applications, and Ryan Wilson with Fisheries and Ecological Services. We are all members of the Alaska Data Stewardship Team (DST), a cross-programmatic group of data management advocates working to improve data management in Alaska.

# How can we improve data management?

???
During one of our first meetings for the DST, we quickly agreed that our goal was to improve data management. The hard question though was "How?".

We following the steps of many new groups- identify the fundamental problem that we face and contributing factors to that problem. We all agreed that we as a region are not managing our data to following best practices. But why? Why aren't we meeting that vision for success? What factors are contributing to our apparent lack of success?

Being a group of technical-minded people, discussions initially focused on capacity issues. Maybe we don't have the systems in place to manage our data or create machine-readable metadata. Maybe staff aren't familiar with these systems and need training. Many we need more specialized technical staff (data managers) to led us to success. 

While these factors are arguably important contributors, there was a fundamental issue that we kept coming back to the human dimension side of the problem: people simply aren't doing it because they don't see value, or they see value but it is a lower priority than other work at hand.

## Technical problems

- **Easy** to identify
- Solved **quickly** by edict

- Quick and easy solution solved by outside experts or authority

- People generally receptive to the change

- Solutions are quickly implemented by edict

## Adaptive problems

- **Difficult** to identify (easy to deny)
- Solution requires a **change in values, roles, and work approaches**

- People facing the problem need to do the work to solve it

- People are resistant to even acknowledging the challenge

- Solutions are complex, unclear and require time and new discoveries

In short, we were not dealing with solely technical problem. Data management is an adaptive challenge

- Poor data management is not just a "biologist problem"
- Success requires implementing accountability across roles and organizational levels
- Ok, many of you may be saying "that's great. We know that. But how"?

Some notes

# 1. Start with yourself

.pull-left[
![](images/be_the_change.jpeg)
]

.pull-right[
.large[
Familiarize yourself with laws and policies related to FWS data.

Learn about your available systems, guidance, and tools for managing data and metadata.

Apply these to your work.

# 2. Adopt data management workflows

.pull-left[
.large[
Incorporate data management into **all** project and funding workflows

Expect (require?) data management best practices 

Leverage for change when you can

# 2. Engage leadership

.pull-left[
.large[
Seek out data management advocates.

Present "non-invasive" actions that leaders could act upon.

Include leaders in data management groups and advertise successes.

.pull-right[

???
Seek out senior leaders that are advocates of data management. Former biologists? Those that understand the added value of good data management.

# 3. Effectively communicate

.pull-left[
.large[
Share data management expectations with staff

Share successes

Demonstrate the utility of our systems

???
Share data management expectations with staff
 - True for all levels. Field staff share with seasonals and volunteers, supervisors share with their employees, and senior leader share with their programs.

---
# 4. Measure success

.pull-left[
.large[
Quantify the current state of data management

Develop and use tools to measure progress
]

.pull-right[

]

???
Ask yourself: is my team following data management best practices (and policy requirement)? How do you know?

Understanding whether your strategies and actions are effective in meeting your goals for data management requires a baseline assessment of the current state of affairs. 

Asking staff to meet a standard requires a measure of whether that standard has been met. 


---
# Summary

- Data management is an **adaptive challenge that will not be solved by technology alone**.

- **Everybody must play a role** in meeting our data management goals.

- **Leadership engagement is critical** for developing accountability.

- Effective and regular communication **at all levels** is important.

- **Understand your current state** of data management. Think about **how you will assess performance and success** of your strategies.
