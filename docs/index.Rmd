Hello and welcome. I'm McCrea Cobb, a biometrician with the refuge's Inventory and Monitoring Program, based in Anchorage, Alaska. My coauthors on this presentation represent other programs in Alaska - Erik Osnas with Migratory Birds, Amy Pocewicz with Science Applications, and Ryan Wilson with Fisheries and Ecological Services. We are all members of the Alaska Data Stewardship Team (DST), a cross-programmatic group of data management advocates working to improve data management in Alaska.

## Technical problems

- **Easy** to identify
- Solved **quickly** by edict  
<br>
  
- Quick and easy solution solved by outside experts or authority

- People generally receptive to the change

- Solutions are quickly implemented by edict

.pull-right[
## Adaptive problems

- **Difficult** to identify (easy to deny)
- Solution requires a **change in values, roles, and work approaches**

- People facing the problem need to do the work to solve it

- People are resistant to even acknowledging the challenge

- Solutions are complex, unclear and require time and new discoveries

During one of our first meetings for the DST, we following the steps of many new groups- identify the fundamental problem that we face and contributing factors to that problem. We all agreed that we as a region are not managing our data to following best practices. But why? Why aren't we meeting that vision for success? What factors are contributing to our apparent lack of success?

Being a group of technical-minded people, discussions initially focused on capacity issues. Maybe we don't have the systems in place to manage our data or create machine-readable metadata. Maybe staff aren't familiar with these systems and need training. Many we need more specialized technical staff (data managers) to led us to success. 

While these factors are arguably important contributors, there was a fundamental issue that we kept coming back to the human dimension side of the problem: people simply aren't doing it because they don't see value, or they see value but it is a lower priority than other work at hand.

In short, we were not dealing with solely technical problem. Data management is an adaptive challenge

- Poor data management is not just a "biologist problem"
- Success requires implementing accountability across roles and organizational levels
- Ok many of you may be saying. That's great. We know that. But how?
