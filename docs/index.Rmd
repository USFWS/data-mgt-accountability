# How do we improve data management?

???
My coauthors and I are members of the Alaska Data Stewardship Team, which was founded a few years ago to focus on regional data management issues. During one of our first meetings for the DST, we quickly agreed that our goal was to improve data management. That was easy. The hard question though was "How?".

We following the steps of many new groups- identify the fundamental problem that we face and contributing factors to that problem. We all agreed that we as a region are not managing our data  following best practices. But why? Why aren't we meeting that vision for success? What factors were contributing to our apparent lack of success?

Being a group of technically-minded people, some of our initial discussions focused on capacity issues that are within our wheelhouse: technical capacity issues.

While these factors are arguably important contributors, we kept coming back to the human dimension side of the problem: people simply aren't doing it because they don't see value, or they see value but it is a lower priority than other work at hand.

A manager that was a part of these initial discussion then pointed out that we are not dealing with a technical problem. What we were facing was an adaptive challenge.

So what's the difference and why is this important to data management?

A paper in the Harvard Business Review outlined the difference. Most notably, unlike technical problems, adaptive challenges are difficult to even identify and solving them requires a change in values, roles, and work approaches. While technical problems can be quickly solved by experts or authority external to the problem, solving adaptive challenges requires the people that are facing the challenge to do that work to solve it. People are generally resistant to even acknowledging adaptive challenges and the solutions are complex and require time and new discoveries.  

So how does this apply to data management?

???
- The bottom line is that tackling data management problems will require a group effort. Everybody will have to play a role in solving our adaptive challenge.

- Solving poor data management is not just a biologist or data manager problem. FWS employees across all programs and grade-levels have roles and it will not be solved solely by those most affected or technical IT staff.

- Success requires implementing accountability across roles and organizational levels, as we say, from program directors to data collectors.

# Lessons from Alaska: 
## Six actions to increase accountability

???
Ok, many of you may be saying "That's great. We know that. I'm not a program director or even a supervisor, so what can I do to improve accountability?".

Nationally, we are starting to lay the groundwork for accountability by explicitly defining data management roles and responsibilities in the new data management policy.

Now I'll share six actions from Alaska to consider that seem to be moving us in the right direction.



---
# 1. Start with yourself

.pull-left[
![](images/be_the_change.jpeg)
]

.pull-right[
.large[
Familiarize yourself with laws and policies related to FWS data.

Learn about your available systems, guidance, and tools for managing data and metadata.

Apply these to your work.
]
]

???
The first step to any change, and arguably the easiest, is to **change yourself**. For data management, that would mean becoming familiar with laws and policies related to data management. Participate on a regional or national data management team. Learn about what data management systems (ServCat) and tools (mdEditor) are available to you and read the guidance. Apply them to your data.

Being a member of our regional Data Stewardship Team, I have learned a lot about data management that I now apply to my work and share with others.

# 2. Adopt data management workflows

#2 Adopt data management workflows.

Secondly, incorporate data management into **all** your project and funding workflows.

- What do I mean by that? Consider the data life cycle. Perhaps the easiest place to advocate for data management is in the initial planning stage. 

- If your position is involved in allocating resources and funding, require a data management plan and metadata with project proposals. Data management should not be an afterthought. Once funding has been allocated, the opportunity has been lost to account for data management best practices. If necessary, slow down the process to allow for time to consider data management: request proposals for projects in upcoming years. This is an approach taken by the Park Service. This can reduce our maniac desire to get out in the field and start gathering data before data management is considered. In Alaska, The Fisheries and Ecological Service Program is starting to require data management plans and metadata in new project proposals.

- If you are leader, you can expect your staff to be following data management best practices. When asking staff for data or a report, rather than requesting them to attach the data or report to an email attachment, indicate that you want a hyperlink to a data repository where they are archived. Or better yet, use the data systems that we have to find it yourself. If you are providing kudos for a survey product, make sure that the products have been documented and archived. When assessing performance, quantify output by how many records have been created in the data system. If it's not documented and archived, it's not completed. Collecting data is not completing a survey. These actions all demonstrate and increase the value of our data management systems. 

- Finally, not all of us are supervisors and have the ability to maintain accountability. But, if you job provides a desired service to folks producing data, use that carrot to leverage for data management best practices. Refuge biometricians and data managers in Alaska that receive requests for technical support from field staff now require that the project has been documented in the refuge survey database "PRIMR" and that all associated data is archived with metadata. We're here to help, but you need to meet us halfway.

# 4. Engage leadership

.pull-left[

???
- Thirdly, seek out senior leaders that are advocates of data management. They're out there. Former biologists. Those that understand the added value of good data management. These people can not only advocate for data management, but can provide critical feedback on proposed approaches to meeting your goals. How should you present these ideas to other leaders? The timing and message?

- Present some "non-invasive" actions for leaders to act upon. You are likely the technical expert and have thought more abut the problem than others. Propose small changes that together could message the importance of data management to staff. Show that you have thought through more long-term strategies that will build upon these immediate small actions. In Alaska, we have meet with Refuge supervisors and provided them with a list of proposed actions 

- Finally, take opportunities to include supportive leaders in any data management groups. Their input in extremely value and they can make things happen that you might not be able to. This photo is our Regional Director in Alaska providing opening remarks for a recent face-to-face meeting of the Data Stewardship Team.

Clearly communicate expectation.

Share data management expectations with staff
 - True for all levels. Field staff share with seasonals and volunteers, supervisors share with their employees, and senior leader share with their programs.

In Refuges in Alaska, we are working on a memo for our Regional Director to share with staff regarding the importance of data management and clarifying expectations.

Ask yourself: is my team following data management best practices (and policy requirement)? How do you know?

Understanding whether your strategies and actions are effective in meeting your goals for data management requires a baseline assessment of the current state of affairs. 

Asking staff to meet a standard requires a measure of whether that standard has been met. To meet this need, the Fisheries and Ecological Services program in Alaska is starting an effort in FY21 to have data management plans and metadata for all new and existing projects. Also, the Alaska DST is also working on a regional project list. With a project list, it will someday be possible to track whether metadata has been created.

# Summary

.large[
1. Data management is an **adaptive challenge**.

2. **Everybody is accountable** for data management.

3. **Leadership engagement is critical** for instituting accountability.

4. Effective and regular **communication at all levels** is important.

5. **Understand the current state** of your data management. 

6. Consider **how you will assess performance and success** of your strategies.
]

???
Data management = **adaptive challenge**, therefore there is no easy technical solution from an outside expert. It will require changes by those experiencing the challenge.

- **Everybody is accountable**.

- **Leadership engagement is critical** for developing accountability.

- Effective and regular communication **at all levels** is important.

- **Understand your current state** of data management. Think about **how you will assess performance and success** of your strategies.
