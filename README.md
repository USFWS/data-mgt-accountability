## Abstract 
Data management poses an adaptive challenge. Even where we have technical systems and supporting capacity available, examples prevail of struggles to meet data management obligations. Luckily, there are also examples of success that we can learn from and expand. In the Alaska Region, the Data Stewardship Team and program leaders are working within and across Service science programs to identify and strengthen accountability for data management. Nearly all Service staff have a role in data management, and we are implementing actions for accountability across those roles and organizational levels, from program directors to data collectors. Our recommended actions include incorporating data management steps into existing project and funding workflows, developing tools to measure our progress, and enlisting regional leaders to demonstrate that data management is a high priority and effectively communicate those expectations to staff. We will describe early implementation of these and other actions for data management accountability in Alaska and our lessons learned so far.
