# How do we improve data management?

???
My coauthors and I are members of the Alaska Data Stewardship Team, which was founded a few years ago to focus on regional data management issues. During one of our first meetings for the DST, we quickly agreed that our goal was to improve data management. That was easy. The hard question though was "How?".

We following the steps of many new groups- identify the fundamental problem that we face and contributing factors to that problem. We all agreed that we as a region are not managing our data  following best practices. But why? Why aren't we meeting that vision for success? What factors were contributing to our apparent lack of success?

.center[![:scale 60%](images/technology.jpg)]

???
Being a group of technically-minded people, some of our initial discussions focused on capacity issues that are within our wheelhouse. Maybe we don't have the systems in place to manage our data or create machine-readable metadata. Maybe staff aren't familiar with these systems and need training. Many we need more specialized technical staff (data managers) to led us to success. 

While these factors are arguably important contributors, we kept coming back to the human dimension side of the problem: people simply aren't doing it because they don't see value, or they see value but it is a lower priority than other work at hand.

A manager that was a part of these initial discussion then pointed out that we are not dealing with a technical problem. What we were facing was an adaptive challenge.

So what's the difference and why is this important to data management?

A paper in the Harvard Business Review outlined the difference. Most notably, unlike technical problems, adaptive challenges are difficult to even identify and solving them requires a change in values, roles, and work approaches. While technical problems can be quickly solved by experts or authority external to the problem, solving adaptive challenges requires the people that are facing the challenge to do that work to solve it. People are generally resistent to even acknowledging adaptive challenges and the solutions are complex and require time and new discoveries.  

So how does this apply to data management?

- Tackling data management problems will require a group effort. Everybody will have to play a role in solving our adaptive challenge.

- Solving poor data management is not just a "biologist problem". FWS employees across all programs and grade-levels have roles

- Success requires implementing accountability across roles and organizational levels

# Lessons from Alaska: 
## Six actions to increase accountability

???
Ok, many of you may be saying "That's great. We know that. I'm not a senior leader or even a supervisor, so how can I improve accountability!".

Nationally, we are starting to lay the groundwork for accountability by explicitly defining data management roles and responsibilities in the new data management policy.

We don't have all the answers, but I'll share some of the approaches from Alaska to consider that seem to be moving us in the right direction.

# 1. Start with yourself

.pull-right[
.large[
Familiarize yourself with laws and policies related to FWS data.

Learn about your available systems, guidance, and tools for managing data and metadata.

]
]

???
The first step to any change, and arguably the easiest, is to **change yourself**. For data management, that would mean becoming familiar with laws and policies related to data management. Participate on a regional or national data management team. Learn about what data management systems (ServCat) and tools (mdEditor) are available to you and read the guidance. Apply them to your data.

Having participated for the last year on our regional Data Stewardship Team, I have learned a lot about data management that I now apply to my work and share with others.

#3 Adopt data management workflows.

Incorporate data management into **all** project and funding workflows  

- What do I mean by that? Consider the data life cycle. Perhaps the easiest place to advocate for data management is in the initial planning stage. 

- If your position is involved in allocating resources and funding, require a data management plan and metadata with project proposals. Data management should not be an afterthought. Once funding has been allocated, the opportunity has been lost to account for data management best practices. If necessary, slow down the process to allow for time to consider data management: request proposals for projects in upcoming years. This is an approach taken by the Park Service. This can reduce our maniac desire to get out in the field and start gathering data before data management is considered.

- If you are leader, you can expect your staff to be following data management best practices. When asking staff for data or a report, indicate that you want a hyperlink to where they are archived, rather than just getting them in an email attachment. Or better yet, use the data systems that we have to find it yourself. If you are providing kudos for a survey product, make sure that the products have been documented and archived. When assessing performance, quantify output by how many records have been created in the data system. If it's not documented archived, it's not complete. Collecting data is not completing a survey. These actions all demonstrate and increase the value of our data management systems. 

- Finally, not all of our are supervisors and have the ability to maintain accountability. But, if you job provides a desired service to folks producing data, use that carrot to leverage for data management best practices. For example, refuge biometricians in Alaska that receive requests for technical support from field staff now require that the project is documented in the refuge survey database "PRIMR" and that all associated data is archived with metadata. We're here to help, but you need to meet us halfway.

# 4. Engage leadership

- Seek out senior leaders that are advocates of data management. They're out there. Former biologists. Those that understand the added value of good data management. These people can not only advocate for data management, but can provide critical feedback on proposed approaches to meeting your goals. How should you present these ideas to other leaders? The timing and message?

- Present some "non-invasive" actions for leaders to act upon. You are likely the technical expert and have thought more abut the problem than others. Propose small changes that together could message the importance of data management to staff. A memo from a program lead can go a long ways. Show that you have thought through more long-term strategies that will build upon these immediate small actions. 

- Finally, take opportunities to include supportive leaders in any data management groups. Their input in extremely value and they can make things happen that you might not be able to.

Ask yourself: is my team following data management best practices (and policy requirement)? How do you know?

Understanding whether your strategies and actions are effective in meeting your goals for data management requires a baseline assessment of the current state of affairs. 

Asking staff to meet a standard requires a measure of whether that standard has been met.

# Summary

1. Data management is an **adaptive challenge**.

2. **Everybody is accountable** for data management.

3. **Leadership engagement is critical** for instituting accountability.

4. Effective and regular **communication at all levels** is important.

5. **Understand the current state** of your data management. 

6. Consider **how you will assess performance and success** of your strategies.

Data management = **adaptive challenge**, therefore there is no easy technical solution from an outside expert. It will require changes by those experiencing the challenge.

- **Everybody is accountable**.

- **Leadership engagement is critical** for developing accountability.

- Effective and regular communication **at all levels** is important.

- **Understand your current state** of data management. Think about **how you will assess performance and success** of your strategies.
